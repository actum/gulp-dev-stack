# Contributing

@TODO Intro?

* [Clone the repo](https://github.com/actum/gulp-dev-stack) if you haven’t done it already.
* Create a new branch and name it like:
    * `#11-issue-title` where the number is the issue ID
    * `fix/rename-folder` in case you wanna add just a quick fix
* While working, write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* When you’re done, push the new branch: `git push -u origin 11-issue-title`.
* Create a [pull request](https://github.com/actum/gulp-dev-stack/pulls).  (Don’t be afraid to do that, you will still be able to fix thing in the pull request just by committing and pushing the branch.)
* Wait for code review. @TODO assigning desired reviewer?
